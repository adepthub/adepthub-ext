<h3>
<a name="reliable" class="anchor" href="#reliable"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reliable</h3>

<p>Why is reliability is important for a dependency manager and what do we mean by "reliable"? In our context "reliable" means that we get the <strong>exact</strong> same result, every... time... One could think this is the case for all dependency manager but alas it is not. For Ivy and Maven you are completely dependent on the repository not doing something weird, such as hosting snapshots for example. You do not want a dependency manager that is <em>almost</em> reliable (in fact I would say it is worse than having one that is not at all reliable). Reliable is important though, because it makes it easier to reason about what happens, but also because it makes it easier to build tooling around it. What makes Adept reliable?</p>

<ul>
<li>It only does resolution when something is changed (actively) and something which is resolved is always the same.</li>
<li>Resolution uses versioned metadata and always points to a specific commit when resolution happened. Therefore it operates on exactly the SAME content EVERY time. This also means you can easily go back in time.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="high-performance" class="anchor" href="#high-performance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>High performance</h3>

<p>Enhanced performance does not only directly improves developer experience, but can enable build tools to have features that indirectly makes them more pleasant to work with. What makes Adept perform well?</p>

<ul>
<li>Resolution is faster than Ivy/Maven because there are no roundtrips fetching data. This is faster because network IO roundtrips are almost always slower than a batched approach.</li>
<li>Resolution does not need to be done very often. The reason is because we have something called a "lock file" where all the inputs for resolution (requirements, ...) and artifacts (hashes and locations of the files that required) are stored. This lock file is only generated when inputs <strong>changes</strong>.</li>
<li>Artifacts have unique hashes and are only EVER downloaded when a hash is not in cache - the cache never has to be “invalidated” by Adept</li>
<li>Artifacts &amp; repositories are downloaded in parallel and can have multiple locations (downloading from the fastest server)</li>
<li>Artifact and metadata fetching is separated so it is possible to add new artifact download protocols easily (e.g. torrent)</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="distributed" class="anchor" href="#distributed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Distributed</h3>

<p>How is Adept distributed? It is distributed in the sense that metadata can be stored anywhere (any server, locally) and use other metadata from anywhere (any server, locally). That means that, in Adept, we accept that there is metadata everywhere and handle it. The advantages are that it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to publish to and manage your own repository</li>
<li>Works even if you are on the move because it is offline. It is also possible to do offline resolution if the metadata has been downloaded.</li>
<li>Increased flexibility because advanced APIs can easily be built on Adept since metadata is offline: version ranges, ...</li>
<li>Git-like pull requests so anybody can easily improve metadata and contribute. This makes it possible to change metadata if it is wrong, so that everybody can benefit from it.</li>
<li>Easy to do local modifications to metadata to support a specific use case.</li>
<li>Artifacts and repositories can have multiple locations so they are more fault tolerant</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="knows-what-works-with-what" class="anchor" href="#knows-what-works-with-what"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Knows what works with what</h3>

<p>Adept can know what works with what because it uses structured variants instead of "versions" or "semantic versions", i.e. versions that <em>mean</em> something (version 1.0.2 is higher than and compatible with version 1.0.2):</p>

<ul>
<li>No ambiguities: either <em>one</em> module is chosen or <em>none</em>. The author of the module what constraints a user has to specify (must specify a binary-version or even something more exotic the: "verified-by-somebody" constraint). The author is also responsible for what the "best" "versions" are. This is perfect for libraries, platforms and frameworks which have their own ecosystems with  more or less specific requirements.</li>
<li>The resolution engine compares multiple attributes and constraints to each other with simple equality, instead of “smart” and complicated algorithms to figure out what version is “best”. This makes the resolution results simple to understand.</li>
<li>The resolution engine is simple and written on approx 200 lines of code. This means less bugs but also makes it easy to port it to other languages.</li>
<li>The resolution engine will search for the <em>one</em> way of combining the modules that resolves the graph and for which all variants (e.g. the different "versions") are compatible. For example: if you depend on a module, "play-slick", which integrates "play" with "slick", Adept will automatically figure out which "play-slick" variant/"version" you need if "play" and "slick" are specified. This makes Adept easier to use.</li>
<li>Possible to faithfully emulate most (if not all) features of other package managers and any "version-scheme", like "semantic versioning" (Scala 2.1.0 is compatible with 2.1.1 but not with 2.2.1), backwards compatible versioning (Java 1.7.0_51 is compatible with all 1.7.x, 1.6.x, 1.5.x, ...), …</li>
<li>Safe and strict, but also lots of possibilities without having to rewrite or add features to the resolution engine. Features that can/have been added includes conflicts, safe renames, ivy configurations/maven scopes, ...</li>

<a name="faq" class="anchor" href="#faq"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is Adept and AdeptHub trying to become the <em>new standard</em>?

<ul>
<li>We do not care so much about standards as we care about improving the status quo. The way we see it, we simply want to improve the quality of the metadata so it reflects reality (knowing what works with what and how things are compatible) at any given point in time (which means it must be easy to change safely update the metadata). While we were at it, we saw a chance to improve upon other pain-points of some dependency managers when it came to other areas such as reliability and speed. Yes, Adept is something different than Ivy/Maven/... but it was hard for us to solve the problems we wanted to fix while staying compatible with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have you guys read the xkcd strip about standardization?

<ul>
<li>Hehe - yeah, that is a good one! We are all big fans of xkcd at AdeptHub and have been reading it daily for years! Refer to our Q&amp;A on standards for more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I like Maven/Ant/Ivy/(other dependency/package manager) - are you saying you want us to replace it?

<ul>
<li>Nope, if you really are happy with it, chances are you should continue using it. We are constantly thinking of how Adept can help any given build tool or package manager to be better though. We believe that Adept is good news for you still though: we have some tricks we are going to do which will use the metadata and other features of Adept to enhance your experience even if you don't want to switch to Adept! The important thing for us is to get as many library/framework authors/owners to use AdeptHub so that metadata can get better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you know that X dependency/package manager also has Y feature?

<ul>
<li>We have been looking at a lot of dependency/package managers to create a best-of-all-worlds solution. We have not looked into all though so it is possible we have not looked at X or know of Y feature. We believe we have a really nice solution that solves many problems. We also intend to extend and make Adept better with time, and we are open to suggestions and improvements, so if there is something we are missing out on please contact us (fredrik 'at' adepthub.com).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Will AdeptHub support NPM/Bower/CocoaPods/Nuget/Go/Rust/....?

<ul>
<li>We hope so! Our strategy is to make things work on for the Scala and Java ecosystems first, then we will continue to other platforms. Adept does not have any specifics for the Scala and Java ecosystems though so we believe it should be relatively easy to support other ecosystems as well, but even so, it is likely to take time if we want it done properly so help is welcome!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is your license?

<ul>
<li>Adept is under the Apache 2.0 license. For anything all source code related to AdeptHub projects: you may only use the code under certain conditions. You may use AdeptHub source code for any non-commercial and non-competing project, but not for any situation where money is somehow generated or where you will be competing with AdeptHub in any way. Send us a mail (fredrik 'at' adepthub.com) describing your case if you are uncertain. For AdeptHub server, you will need to download a license file. There are licenses for trials, as well as a non-commercial (schools and some not-for-profit usage) and a commercial license (for everybody else). The reasons are obvious, but if they are not: hosting costs money and we want to make a living out of this. Some of us have families that relies on us as an income source and we hope that the value we provide is something people will appreciate enough to want the rights to use our software and services in exchange for their money. Our long term plan is to give money back to the ecosystems though, but we will get back to the specifics later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can I fix an issue or make a  contribution to AdeptHub projects?

<ul>
<li>Of course! Contributions are welcome and we will make sure your name is listed in our credits. For Adept source code, the Apache 2.0 license applies so you are welcome to use it for any project. For AdeptHub source code, note that AdeptHub license will cover your changes as well though.  AdeptHub is founded by the people who wrote the first Adept implementation and that AdeptHub is the steward of Adept, so any donations to AdeptHub (or Adept) will be appreciated as they will be used to build Adept.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I want to build something better than AdeptHub on Adept, is there any limitations?

<ul>
<li>As long as you do not use AdeptHub source code to do this, we cannot stop you. If you are motivated about working within this domain though, perhaps it is easier to join us? Send us a mail (fredrik 'at' adepthub.com) - our company is owned by the developers so joining us will give you a part of the cake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't you agree that the metadata Adept is using is too complex?

<ul>
<li>We can agree that the metadata in Adept is quite complex, but not that it is <em>too</em> complex. There is a reason for it being complex you see, and it's simply because Adept is quite stupid in the sense that it does not take ANY assumptions. Now the question is whether that is a good thing or not. Our argument for it being a good thing is that it makes it possible for Adept to support more use cases in a safe and efficient manner, simply because there is no assumptions that can be broken. What we hope will happen is that there will be tooling built around Adept that will remove the pain. As a comparison: the structure of Git is much more complicated than to that of CVS and Git requires more tooling around it. However, by focusing on being fast, portable/distributed and reliable, Git has been proven to be something which can easily be extended and the tooling we now take for granted is actually (arguably) part of what makes Git great.</li>
